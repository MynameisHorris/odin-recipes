# odin-recipes
This is my first Github linked project, a compilation of things I've learned thus far. The recipes are just what came to mind, food I've had growing up.
I did it all in one go, and never recorded any git messages except one, by accident (the Add README.MD). Tbh the git stuff was more confusing than anything else but we're here now ;p.
