    <p><h2> Meat-stuffed cabbage in a tomato sauce </h2></p>

    <p> The origin of this recipe is unknown, it is a dish which varies in flavor, whether 
        it's made in Hungary, Ukraine, Russia, Poland, or even Germany. Sauerkraut is a common 
        addition to the filling and various meats can be used. </p>
    
    <p> Experiment with different meats that are ethnically appropriate if you'd like
        but I've always enjoyed this relatively minimalist recipe that's easy to make 
        and can even be enjoyed in times when food is scarce. It was passed down by my 
        Ukrainian family. </p>

    <h2> Ingredients </h2>
    <ul>
      <li> 1 head cabbage, cored </li>
      <li> water to cover </li>   
      <li> ¼ teaspoon salt </li>   
      <li> 1 ½ pounds lean ground beef </li>   
      <li> 1 ½ pounds ground pork </li>   
      <li> 1 ½ cups cooked white rice </li>   
      <li> 2 large eggs, slightly beaten </li>   
      <li> ¼ cup finely chopped onion </li>   
      <li> 2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley </li>   
      <li> ½ teaspoon garlic powder </li>   
      <li> ½ teaspoon salt </li>   
      <li> ½ teaspoon ground black pepper </li>   
      <li> 1 (28 ounce) can tomato sauce </li>   
      <li> ¼ cup white vinegar </li>     
      <li> 2 ⅔ tablespoons white sugar </li>
    </ul>
    <h2> Directions </h2>
    <ol>
      <li> Place cabbage in a stockpot; pour over enough water to cover. 
        Add 1/4 teaspoon salt; bring to a boil over medium-high heat. Turn 
        cabbage every 2 to 3 minutes; transfer any leaves that separate from cabbage 
        into a strainer to drain and cool. Continue to boil until all the leaves have 
        cooked, about 15 minutes. Reserve 1 1/2 cups of cabbage cooking water. Cut out 
        the tough, thick center ribs of any large cabbage leaves with a sharp knife. </li>
      <li> Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). </li> 
      <li> Mix ground beef, ground pork, cooked rice, eggs, onion, fresh parsley, 
        garlic powder, salt, and pepper in a large bowl until combined. Lay 1 cabbage 
        leaf on a flat surface; place 1 heaping tablespoon of filling at the base of a 
        cabbage leaf. Overlap with the bottom of the leaf; fold in side edges and roll up. </li>       
      <li> Repeat with remaining large cabbage leaves and filling. </li>
      <li> Cut any leftover cabbage leaves into pieces and place in the bottom of a roasting pan. 
        Layer stuffed cabbage rolls on top. </li>
      <li> Combine tomato sauce, reserved cabbage water, white vinegar, and white sugar 
        in a bowl; pour mixture over cabbage rolls. Cover roasting pan with aluminum foil. </li>
      <li> Bake in the preheated oven until filling is cooked through and sauce has thickened, 
        about 2 1/2 hours. Baste stuffed cabbage rolls every hour. </li>
    </ol>
